    My current research focuses on advancing <strong>Generative AI</strong> for healthcare applications, with specific achievements in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Multimodal Medical AI</strong>: Contributing to GMAI-VL-R1 (RL-enhanced medical reasoning) and vision-language models for text-guided medical image generation and analysis
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Large-scale Synthetic Data Generation</strong>: Contributing to RetinaLogos-1400k dataset (1.4M synthetic retinal images) and scalable workflows for generating millions of high-quality medical training samples
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deep Generative Models</strong>: Contributing to medical image translation, including chest X-ray opacity removal and anatomical structure enhancement
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I have contributed to publications at top-tier venues including <strong>MICCAI 2025</strong> (4 papers: 1 oral, 1 spotlight), <strong>ISBI 2025</strong>, <strong>WACV 2025</strong>, <strong>IJCAI 2025</strong>, <strong>Pattern Recognition Letters</strong>, and <strong>NeurIPS Workshop</strong>.
