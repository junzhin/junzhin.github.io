I am an MRes (Master of Research) student in Machine Learning at Imperial College London, supervised by [**Dr. Matthieu Komorowski**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieukomorowski/) and [**Dr. Guang Yang**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyangmedia/). I obtained my B.Sci. degree in Statistics with a minor in Computing from The University of Melbourne and an Honours degree in Data Science from The University of Sydney.

My current research focuses on applying advanced AI techniques, including:
- **GANs** and **Diffusion Generative models**, to **medical imaging**
- **Medical data Synthesis**
- **CXR image translation and Computer-aid Medical Image Analysis**

**I am actively seeking PhD and RA opportunities.**

Feel free to contact me for research opportunities and collaboration.
