I am a Machine Learning Researcher at Shanghai AI Lab, where I conduct cutting-edge research on multimodal AI models with a focus on medical applications. Currently supervised by **Dr. Junjun He**, my work centers on developing advanced AI systems that bridge the gap between computer vision and healthcare applications.

At Shanghai AI Lab, I conduct research on multimodal models with applications in general medical scenarios, focusing on designing workflows for large-scale data generation to create synthetic datasets with millions of samples. I have led the development of **RetinaLogos**, a groundbreaking text-guided retinal image generation model that synthesizes high-resolution color fundus photography (CFP) images with precise anatomical details. Additionally, I contribute to **Project Imaging-X**, a strategic initiative consolidating 1000+ open medical imaging datasets worldwide to build foundational infrastructure for next-generation medical AI models.

During my time as a Graduate Research Student at Imperial College London (Oct 2023 - Oct 2024), I actively engaged in lab activities including hosting Journal Clubs and collaborating closely with medical and ICU clinicians. I participated in multiple research projects, managed paper submission workflows for top conferences like MICCAI, and contributed to securing industrial funding for innovative research proposals. I completed my MRes with Distinction (First-Class Honours) and achieved **Top 5 ranking** among the entire MRes in AI and ML cohort, supervised by [**Dr. Matthieu Komorowski**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieukomorowski/) and [**Dr. Guang Yang**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyangmedia/).

My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Data Science from The University of Sydney (Overall WAM 89.5 with **University Medal**) and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics from The University of Melbourne (First-Class Honours).

My current research focuses on advancing **Generative AI** for healthcare applications, with specific achievements in:

- **Multimodal Medical AI**: Developing GMAI-VL-R1, a reinforcement learning-enhanced model for complex medical reasoning and decision-making
- **Large-scale Medical Data Synthesis**: Creating the RetinaLogos-1400k dataset with 1.4 million synthetic retinal images for ophthalmology applications
- **Vision-Language Models in Healthcare**: Pioneering text-guided medical image generation and analysis systems
- **Deep Generative Models**: Advancing medical image translation, particularly in chest X-ray opacity removal and anatomical structure enhancement
- **Synthetic Dataset Creation**: Designing scalable workflows for generating millions of high-quality medical training samples

My research has resulted in publications at top-tier venues including **MICCAI 2025** (4 accepted papers, including 1 oral presentation and 1 spotlight), **ISBI 2025**, **WACV 2025**, **IJCAI 2025**, **Pattern Recognition Letters**, and **NeurIPS Workshop**. I have submissions under review at **AAAI 2026**. Key achievements include developing the largest synthetic retinal image dataset (RetinaLogos-1400k with 1.4M images), contributing to Project Imaging-X consolidating 1000+ medical datasets, and advancing reinforcement learning approaches for medical reasoning.

**Awards and Recognition:**

- **Top 5 Master Research Project** among entire MRes in AI and ML cohort, Imperial College London (2024)
- **University Medal** in Bachelor of Science (Honours), University of Sydney (2023)
- **Melbourne International Undergraduate Scholarship**, University of Melbourne (2022)
- **Dean's Honours List**, University of Melbourne (2019)

**I am actively seeking PhD positions for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026, as well as research internship opportunities.**
