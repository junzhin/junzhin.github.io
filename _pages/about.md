I am a Machine Learning Researcher in the **General Medical AI (GMAI)** group at [**Shanghai AI Lab**](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), supervised by [**Dr. Junjun He**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z4LgebkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), focusing on multimodal AI for medical applications. My work centers on large-scale synthetic data generation, including **RetinaLogos** (text-driven retinal image synthesis with precise anatomical details) and **Project Imaging-X** (consolidating 1000+ medical imaging datasets worldwide for next-generation medical AI infrastructure).

I completed my MRes with Distinction at Imperial College London (Oct 2023 - Oct 2024), supervised by [**Dr. Matthieu Komorowski**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xpAYtroAAAAJ&hl=en) and [**Dr. Guang Yang**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZfzEFpsAAAAJ&hl=en), collaborating with medical clinicians and contributing to MICCAI submissions and research funding proposals.

My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Data Science with **University Medal** and a concurrent Diploma in Computing from The University of Sydney, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics from The University of Melbourne (First-Class Honours).
