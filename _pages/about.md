I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Shanghai AI Lab, where I conduct cutting-edge research on multimodal AI models with a focus on medical applications. Currently supervised by **Dr. Junjun He**, my work centers on developing advanced AI systems that bridge the gap between computer vision and healthcare applications.

At Shanghai AI Lab, I design and optimize large-scale data generation workflows to create synthetic datasets for training AI models with millions of samples. One of my flagship projects is **RetinaLogos**, where I developed a text-guided retinal image generation model that produces high-resolution color fundus photography (CFP) images with precise anatomical details for downstream medical applications.

Previously, I completed my MRes (Master of Research) in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Imperial College London with Distinction (First-Class Honours), supervised by [**Dr. Matthieu Komorowski**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieukomorowski/) and [**Dr. Guang Yang**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyangmedia/). My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Data Science from The University of Sydney (Overall WAM 89.5 with University Medal) and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics from The University of Melbourne.

My current research focuses on advancing **Generative AI** for healthcare applications, with specific achievements in:

- **Multimodal Medical AI**: Developing GMAI-VL-R1, a reinforcement learning-enhanced model for complex medical reasoning and decision-making
- **Large-scale Medical Data Synthesis**: Creating the RetinaLogos-1400k dataset with 1.4 million synthetic retinal images for ophthalmology applications
- **Vision-Language Models in Healthcare**: Pioneering text-guided medical image generation and analysis systems
- **Deep Generative Models**: Advancing medical image translation, particularly in chest X-ray opacity removal and anatomical structure enhancement
- **Synthetic Dataset Creation**: Designing scalable workflows for generating millions of high-quality medical training samples

My research has resulted in publications at top-tier conferences including **NeurIPS**, **MICCAI**, **ISBI**, and **Pattern Recognition Letters**. I have contributed to multiple breakthrough projects that advance the state-of-the-art in medical AI, including the development of the largest synthetic retinal image dataset (1.4M images) and novel reinforcement learning approaches for medical reasoning.

**I am actively seeking PhD positions for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026, as well as research internship opportunities.**

Feel free to contact me for research opportunities and collaboration.
