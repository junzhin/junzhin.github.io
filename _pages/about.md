I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Shanghai AI Lab, specializing in AI and Machine Learning with a focus on Computer Vision, Medical
Imaging, AI for Healthcare, and Generative AI. I completed my MRes (Master of Research) in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at
Imperial College London with Distinction (First-Class Honours), supervised by [**Dr. Matthieu Komorowski**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieukomorowski/) and [**Dr. Guang Yang**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyangmedia/).

My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Data Science from The University of Sydney (Overall WAM 89.5 with
University Medal), a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics from The University of Melbourne, and a concurrent diploma in Computing.

My current research focuses primarily on **Generative AI** and its applications in various domains, with specific emphasis on:
- **Generative AI** and **Deep Generative Models**
- **Multimodal AI Systems** and **Vision-Language Models**
- **Reinforcement Learning** for **AI Reasoning and Decision Making**

**I am actively seeking PhD positions for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026, as well as research internship opportunities.**

Feel free to contact me for research opportunities and collaboration.
