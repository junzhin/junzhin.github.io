I am a Machine Learning Researcher at [**Shanghai AI Lab**](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), supervised by [**Dr. Junjun He**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z4LgebkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), focusing on multimodal AI for medical applications. My work centers on large-scale synthetic data generation, including **RetinaLogos** (text-driven retinal image synthesis with precise anatomical details) and **Project Imaging-X** (consolidating 1000+ medical imaging datasets worldwide for next-generation medical AI infrastructure).

I completed my MRes with Distinction at Imperial College London (Oct 2023 - Oct 2024), supervised by [**Dr. Matthieu Komorowski**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xpAYtroAAAAJ&hl=en) and [**Dr. Guang Yang**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZfzEFpsAAAAJ&hl=en), collaborating with medical clinicians and contributing to MICCAI submissions and research funding proposals.

My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Data Science with **University Medal** and a concurrent Diploma in Computing from The University of Sydney, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics from The University of Melbourne (First-Class Honours).

My current research focuses on advancing **Generative AI** for healthcare applications, with specific achievements in:

- **Multimodal Medical AI**: Contributing to GMAI-VL-R1 (RL-enhanced medical reasoning) and vision-language models for text-guided medical image generation and analysis
- **Large-scale Synthetic Data Generation**: Contributing to RetinaLogos-1400k dataset (1.4M synthetic retinal images) and scalable workflows for generating millions of high-quality medical training samples
- **Deep Generative Models**: Contributing to medical image translation, including chest X-ray opacity removal and anatomical structure enhancement

I have contributed to publications at top-tier venues including **MICCAI 2025** (4 papers: 1 oral, 1 spotlight), **ISBI 2025**, **WACV 2025**, **IJCAI 2025**, **Pattern Recognition Letters**, and **NeurIPS Workshop**.

**Awards and Recognition:**

- **University Medal**, Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Data Science, University of Sydney (2023)
- **Dean's Honours List for Data Science**, University of Sydney (2023)
- **Melbourne International Undergraduate Scholarship**, University of Melbourne (2022)
- **Dean's Honours List**, University of Melbourne (2019)

**I am actively seeking PhD positions for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026, as well as research internship opportunities.**

Feel free to contact me for research opportunities and collaboration.
