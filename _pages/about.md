I am a Machine Learning Researcher in the **General Medical AI (GMAI)** group at [**Shanghai AI Lab**](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), supervised by [**Dr. Junjun He**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z4LgebkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research focuses on **generative AI** and **multimodal learning** for medical applications, specializing in large-scale synthetic data generation and deep generative models. I work on developing scalable workflows to create millions of high-quality medical training samples, addressing critical challenges in data scarcity and domain adaptation for healthcare AI.

I completed my MRes with **Distinction** at Imperial College London (Oct 2023 - Oct 2024), Supervised by [**Dr. Matthieu Komorowski**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xpAYtroAAAAJ&hl=en) and [**Dr. Guang Yang**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZfzEFpsAAAAJ&hl=en) jointly, I developed deep generative models for chest X-ray image translation to improve diagnostic accuracy. During this period, I collaborated with ICU clinicians and contributed to research proposals for industrial funding.

My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Data Science with **University Medal** from The University of Sydney, a concurrent Diploma in Computing, and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics from The University of Melbourne (First-Class Honours).
