## Research Problem

### Medical Image Grounding Challenges

Medical image grounding involves:
- **Precise Localization**: Identifying exact spatial locations of medical findings
- **Semantic Understanding**: Connecting textual descriptions with visual features
- **Clinical Accuracy**: Ensuring medically relevant and accurate interpretations
- **Multi-scale Analysis**: Handling findings at different spatial scales

### Traditional Limitations

Existing approaches suffer from:
- **Imprecise Localization**: Difficulty in pinpointing exact anatomical regions
- **Semantic Gaps**: Misalignment between textual descriptions and visual features
- **Limited Clinical Validation**: Lack of medical expert verification
- **Scale Sensitivity**: Poor performance on multi-scale pathological findings

## Technical Innovation

### Spatial-Semantic Reward System

Our approach introduces a sophisticated reward mechanism that considers:

1. **Spatial Accuracy**: Precise localization rewards based on ground truth annotations
2. **Semantic Consistency**: Alignment between textual descriptions and visual features
3. **Clinical Relevance**: Medical expert-validated reward signals
4. **Group Coherence**: Consistency across related medical findings

### Group Relative Policy Optimization

The **Group Relative Policy Optimization** framework:
- **Groups Related Findings**: Clusters similar pathological patterns
- **Relative Ranking**: Learns comparative relationships between different findings
- **Policy Gradient Learning**: Optimizes localization policies through reinforcement learning
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Balances multiple clinical objectives
