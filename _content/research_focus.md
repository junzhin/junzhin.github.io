My current research focuses on advancing **Generative AI** for healthcare applications, with specific achievements in:

- **Multimodal Medical AI**: Contributing to GMAI-VL-R1 (RL-enhanced medical reasoning) and vision-language models for text-guided medical image generation and analysis
- **Large-scale Synthetic Data Generation**: Contributing to RetinaLogos-1400k dataset (1.4M synthetic retinal images) and scalable workflows for generating millions of high-quality medical training samples
- **Deep Generative Models**: Contributing to medical image translation, including chest X-ray opacity removal and anatomical structure enhancement

I have contributed to publications at top-tier venues including **MICCAI 2025** (4 papers: 1 oral, 1 spotlight), **ISBI 2025**, **WACV 2025**, **IJCAI 2025**, **Pattern Recognition Letters**, and **NeurIPS Workshop**.
